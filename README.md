# Amazon DynamoDB Movies Demo

This demo uses Amazon DynamoDB with Next.js to fetch movies from the database. It is able to securely connect to DynamoDB without using hardcoded access tokens through Vercel's [OIDC Federation](https://vercel.com/docs/security/secure-backend-access/oidc) using Vercel native integration.
